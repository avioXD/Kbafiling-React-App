    content: `In general, there are two types of taxes in India – direct tax and indirect tax. Direct tax is a tax that is calculated and paid directly on your Income e.g. tax on salary etc. Income tax is a direct tax. Indirect tax is a tax that is indirectly charged to you on purchase of goods or use of service e.g. Buying a mobile phone or eating in a fast food joint. The seller of the mobile phone or the fast food service provider charges you tax and then deposits the same to the Government account. Most indirect taxes are now covered under Goods and Services Tax (GST), a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax. Everyone who earns income above a certain amount is subject to income tax. Your income could be from salary, interest income from savings, income from mutual funds, sale of property or business or professional income. Income tax rates are pre-decided at the start of the year in the Union Budget (in the Parliament of India). The tax paid or deducted on these incomes is called the income tax. Filing income tax is every citizen’s responsibility. The IT department verifies these declarations of income and if any amount has been paid in excess, the department refunds the amount to the assessee’s bank account. All entities are required to file the taxes on time to avoid penalty. The form that contains information of income and tax paid of an assessee is called Income Tax Return. The Income Tax Department of India has various forms for it such as ITR 1, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4S, ITR 5, ITR 6 and ITR 7.`,
